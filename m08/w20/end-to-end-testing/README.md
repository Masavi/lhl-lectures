# M08-W20 | End-to-End Testing with Cypress

## Topics to cover

* [X] 1. What is Cypress?
* [X] 2. Getting Started with Cypress

## Unit and Integration

* Unit: testing a single piece of code (function / component)
* Integration: testing how units work *together*

We used Jest last day to write some unit / integration tests.

* Jest is a testing framework
* CLI tool
* Originally intended for React
* Automated testing

Pros of Jest?

* Quick to write targetted / technical tests
* Excels at unit / integration tests
* Very easy to test at an atomic level (turn off, or don't call what isn't needed)
* Easy mocking of functions (also avail. in Cypress)
* Very fast, very efficient
* Integrates nicely with our Git / GitHub repos (also avail. in Cypress)

## End-to-End

* End-to-End: "simulate" user behaviour; test whole user stories

Cypress! What is it?

* JavaScript Web Testing and Component Testing Framework
* --> integration or end-to-end
* Opens a browser window and navigates a web site like a end-user would

Pros of Cypress?
* Easy mocking of functions (also avail. in Jest)
* Integrates nicely with our Git / GitHub repos (also avail. in Jest)
* Opens doors to testing responsive features
* High confidence the app behaves appropriately for users
* Able to watch the test process (help with debugging)
* Tests more than just "code", we can check content, CSS, etc. potentially
* Cypress is capable of taking screenshots and video recordings of its tests
* Completely language / stack agnostic, can write tests for any web app you can access in the browser, local or otherwise
* Documentation and UI are very mature and premium

## About Cypress

Cypress is a very robust program, capable of automated testing. The documentation is top-tier, a true treat and pleasure to work with. Tests, similar to Jest/Mocha/Chai, are written in near-plain English, allowing for a wide array of team members to contribute to a project's quality assurance. Tests like these are expected to be run before (and during process of) launch of a project or version thereofâ€”think of it as a safeguard step to prevent launching a project with missing or broken core features. As for quality assurance, Cypress is an amazing tool, ensuring the app is navigable and functional from the browser the same way a user would! It is capable of exporting screenshots and even video of tests and their results, making it great for easy sharing with a team or client. It is a very, very mature library and features an exceptional graphical user interface (GUI) toolset. It's specialties include wholistic integration and full-on end-to-end testing of applications. Because it can load both local files or external web pages/documents via a browser, you can even write tests involving (or exclusively encompassing) external projects of which you have no source-code access.

## Setting up Cypress

Install the package and dependencies:
`npm i cypress --save-dev`

First time set-up:
`./node_modules/.bin/cypress install`

Run cypress in-project via:
`./node_modules/.bin/cypress open`

## Folders/Files and their Purposes!

* `/cypress.json`: Used to override default configuration values.
* `/cypress/fixtures`: Test data; often in JSON.
* `/cypress/integration`: Our test specifications.
* `/cypress/plugins`: Add-ons to expand on Cypress' functionality.
* `/cypress/support`: Scripts; an area where we can add on to Cypress if needed.

## Common Commands

* [describe(), it(), and beforeEach()](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/bundled-tools#Mocha) are afforded to us by Mocha.
    * Describe is used to, well, describe a block of tests!
    * It is used to label a specific test block / unit.
    * BeforeEach allows us an opportunity to add code/setup that will run before each text in the block.
* [cy.visit()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/visit#Syntax) visits a web page.
* [cy.get()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/get) Retrieves an HTML element based on jQuery/CSS-like selectors.
    * [<entity>.as()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/as) Assign an alias for later use in cy.get() or cy.wait(), use an `@` in a selector to call upon an alias.
* [<element>.find()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/find) Retrieves a child element from inside of a selected element.
* [cy.intercept()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/intercept) Used for "spying" (checking for use of a particular request) or "stubbing" (replacing the response for a particular request.)
* [cy.wait()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/wait) Waits before proceding with test instructions.
* [<element>.click()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/click), [<element>.type()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/type), [<element>.check()](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/check) are used to interact with elements and forms in a web page.
